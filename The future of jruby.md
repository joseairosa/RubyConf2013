### The Future of JRuby

- New version is going to be JRuby 9000 (yes seriously, it's over 9000!!!!)
- It will break a lot of things but it will also clean most of the crap from older versions
- It will only be compatible with Ruby 2.1
- Trying to improve collaboration with MRI development
- Things to look for
  - Improved performance
  - Compile to Bytecode, letting the JVM do the work
  - Invokedynamic, Ruby as fast as Java (in theory)
- Truffle/Graal it's 5x6-x times faster than JRuby but it still only supports less than half of MRI
- IR (Internal Representation) is JRuby's next runtime
- Making a move to JRuby will save you money as well in AWS
- There are still stuff that is not thread safe
  - `@count += 1` is not thread safe
  - `@count ||= MyCache.new` is not thread safe
  - `hamster` gem is 100% thread safe
  - `atomic gem` 
  - Concurrency can work in Ruby, but you need to use the right tools for it
- `Rsense` is great for `vi` or `emacs` code completion
- `smart_diff` is great for enhanced code diff
- Ruby 2.1 added trace probes to MRI
