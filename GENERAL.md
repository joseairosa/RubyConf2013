## General stuff picked up from the conference

### Remote work

- [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) for remote work and for those that use IDE [Saros Project](http://www.saros-project.org/)
  - Consider also [Wemux](https://github.com/zolrath/wemux) for remote pairing
- What I found out was that not many companies are doing pure pairing work. They simply split the work among the team and sync every now and then. This removed the collab issue, however it doesn't solve it :)
- While in the conference and speaking with a lot of people/companies we found this service [https://floobits.com/](https://floobits.com/). Some people tested and are using it currently and prefer it over screenhero and other services. I think we should definitely give it a try.

### Generic ideas

- Separate specific app services into their own services. For example, LivingSocial used to have everything in one single application, recently they moved all of their sections (we call them verticals) into separate services which made development easier.
