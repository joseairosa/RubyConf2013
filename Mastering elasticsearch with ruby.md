### Mastering Elasticsearch  With Ruby 

- Extending search capabilities
- Elastic search also provides analytics capabilities
- Very easy to scale
- Built on top of apache lucene
- Uses JSON Documents which makes it really easy to integrate with mongodb
- It's a REST API, we can use curl
- USe Tire (now Re-Tire) gem to interact with ES. Note that it's being deprecated because ES is developing their own
- You can get this as a service but it's expensive. However we can always do it ourselves
